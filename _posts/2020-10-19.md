I've been learning the basics of Linux system administration on this [challenge][linux-admin-challenge] for the past few days, and I took some notes on useful commands and their usages. 

#### User and Permission
- `chmod` changes permissions on files  

  Example:
  - ```chmod -x [filename]``` changes permission to allow excuting the program by everyone 
  - ``chmod 755 [filename]`` changes permision to `rwxr-xr-x`

- `groups` lists groups that current user is member of

- `useradd` adds an user to the system  
  
  Example:
  ```useradd [username]``` add a user with given name to the system

- `userdel` deletes users from the system
  + `-r` removig user's home directory, in addtion to users and groups

  Example:
  ```userdel [username]``` remove a user with given name to the system

- `usermod` modifies the system account files
  + `-a` appends a user to the group[s]. Should be used with the `-G` option
  + `-G` is a list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of

  Example:
  - ```usermod -a -G [groupname] [username]``` appends the user to the group

- `passwd` sets password
  
  Example:
  - ```passwd [username]``` sets the password of a user with the given name


#### Networking
- `ss` outputs "**s**ocket **s**tatus"
    - `-l` displays only listening sockets
    - `-t` displays tcp sockets
    - `-p` shows processes using socket

   Example:
   - ```ss -ltp``` outputs list of listening tcp sockets

- `netstat` prints routing tables, network connection etc.
  - `-v` prints verbosely
  - `-r` prints the kernel routing table
  - `-l` shows only listening sockets
  - `-t` shows tcp sockets
  - `-u` shows udp sockets

  Examples:
  - ```netstat -rn``` prints kernel routing table with numeric ip addresses
  - ```netstat -lnt``` prints lists of tcp sockets with numeric ip addresses

- `nmap` scans open ports at an ip address  
  
  Example:
  - `nmap [ip_address]`

- `ufw` (**u**ncomplicated **f**ire**w**all) sets firewall setting  
  - `allow` allows accesses using a specified protocol
  - `deny`  denies accesses using a specified protocol
  Examples: 
    - ```sudo ufw allow ssh``` allows ssh access
    - ```sudo ufw deny http``` denies http requests  
    - ```sudo ufw enable``` enables the settings registered

- `iptables` and `nftables` are other options of using `ufw`. They enable to set up more complecated stuff


#### Utilities

- `hisotry` shows command history   
  - `Ctrl + r` enables to search from the history

- `ls` lists out filenames
    - `-r`: reverse
    - `-t`: sort by time
    - `-l`: use a long listing format

- `tail` outputs last 10 commands
    - `-f` outputs real time updates on the target file

- `grep` searches for a keyword in an output and print the lines with the keyword
    narrows the matching that includes `more` 
    + `-v` invert search to select non matching lines
    + `-i` case insensitive search
    + `-r` reads all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line. 
    + `-R` reads all files under each directory, recursively, following all symbolic links  
  
  Examples:
    - `grep 'something' [filename] | grep 'more'`  

- `cut` command to select out most interesting portions of each line
    - `-d` selects delimeter
    - `-f` specifies the fields of interests (i.e. `-f 1-3`)
    - `-c` specifies the charactors of interest (i.e. `-f 1,3`)
    - `-b` specifies the byte portion of the filee

- `cron` can schedule to run a program

- `test` evaluates conditional expression
  + `-a` returns true if the file exists
  + `-x` returns true if the file is excutable by the user
  + `-d` returns true if the file is a directory

  Example: 
  - `test -x [filename]` returns true if the file is excutable 

- `locate` finds files that maches the input. It is faster than grep or find, since it uses a index from a database that is only updated by `cron` once a day, so newly updated files may not appear to the result  

  Example:
  - `locate "[regex]"`

- `updatedb` updates the database that sotres index for file names, which is used by the `locate` commnad

- `find` searches down through a directory structure looking for files which match to the input
    - `-name` maches filename 
    - `-iname` matches filename case insensitively
    - `-type [charactor]` mathes the files of types where `charactor` is `b`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `p`, `f` and `s`.  
    - `-mtime -[number]` searchs for any file modified last `number` days
    - `-not` inverts the result of a search
    - `-user [username]` seaches for files that owned by the user
    - `-size` finds files of particular size
    - `-exec` allows seach from a result of command 

- `tar` stores multiple files in an archive file
  + `-c` creates a new archive
  + `-v` list files processed verbosely 
  + `-r` append files or directories to an archive file(or compressed tar file)
  + `-A` append archive to the end of another archive  
  + `-z` compress an archive file in the gzip format
  + `-f` uses archive file 
  + `-j` compress an archive file in the bzip2 format
  
  Examples:
    - `tar -cvf [tar-filename] [dirname]` create a tar archive
    - `tar -cvzf [compressed-tar-file-name] [dirname]` creates a  gzip compressed archive file
    - `tar -jcvf [compressed-tar-file-name] [dirname]` creates a bzip2 compressed  archive file 
    - `tar -tvf [tar-filename or compressed-tar-filename]` lists the content of an achrchive file
    - `tar -xvf [tar-file-name or compressed-tar-filename]` untar or uncompresses an achrchive file 
    - `tar -xvf [tar-filename] [target-filename..]` untar specific file(s) from an archive file
    - `tar -zxvf [tar-filename] [target-filename..]` uncompress specific file(s) from an gzip commpressed archive file
    - `tar -jxvf [tar-filename] [target-filename..]` uncompress specific file(s) from an bzip2 commpressed archive file
    - `tar -czf - [tar-filename or compressed-tar-filename] | wc -c` outputs the size of an archive file  
  
  Refer to [this question][tar-options] for old style option without a dash and short option with a dash

- `wget` downloads files from the Web  
  - `-v` outputs verbosely
  - `-O` specifies download path. If the target filename is not given, it redirect the output to standard output.  
  
  Example:
  - ```wget -v [URL]``` downloads a file from the URL

- `curl` also downloads files from the Web, but it doesn't support recursive downloads like `wget` does
  + `-o` specifies download path
  + `-x` accesses target file via proxy server
  
  Example:
  - ```curl -o [filename] [URL]```

#### APT Repositories
- `apt-cache dump` shows a short listing of every package in the cache  

  Examples:
  - ```apt-cache dump | grep "Package:" | wc -l``` lists how many packages are available

- `apt search` searches package from apt cache
